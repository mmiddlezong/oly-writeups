  There are twelve candies arranged in a circle, four of which are rare candies.
  Chad and Eric want to collaborate on a strategy for the following act.
  First, Eric comes and is told which four candies are rare candies,
  then removes four non-rare candies from the circle.
  Then Eric leaves, and Chad comes and must determine which of the
  four candies (of the eight remaining candies) are rare.
  Decide whether this is possible or not.

If $k \le \frac{n}{2}$, then the desired result is trivial.
Otherwise, we claim that any set of $k > \frac n2$ gifts is compatible with all $n$ boxes.

  That is, find an infinite bipartite graph between
  countably infinite sets $A$ and $B$
  for which every finite subset of $S \subseteq A$
  has at least $|S|$ neighbors in $B$,
  but there is no way of matching $A$ to a subset of $B$.

Match $0$ in $A$ with all numbers in $B$, and

Clearly, there cannot be a perfect matching, even though the two sets
have the same cardinality.

  Santa Claus has some gifts for $n$ children.
  For $1 \le i \le n$, the $i$-th child considers $x_i > 0$ of these items to be desirable.
  Assume that \[  \frac{1}{x_1} + \dots + \frac{1}{x_n} \le 1. \]
  Prove that Santa Claus can give each child a gift that this child likes.
\end{problem} \printpuid{13BWAY}

%% Type your solution to Baltic Way 2013 (\href{https://otis.evanchen.cc/arch/13BWAY/}{13BWAY}) here ...
We claim that in any set of $k$ children, at least one of them likes at least $k$ of Santa's gifts.
This is clearly sufficient to prove Hall's condition, and thus, the desired conclusion.

Suppose not. Then, summing over the $k$ children,
\[ \sum_{i \in S} \frac{1}{x_i} > \sum_{i \in S} \frac{1}{k} = 1, \]
which, when combined with the problem statement's condition, gives us a contradiction.

\begin{reqproblem}[$3\clubsuit$]
  On a $1000 \times 1000$ chessboard, we delete some squares from the board
  so that each row and each column has at most $k$ deleted squares.
  For which values of $k$ is it always still possible to
  place $1000$ non-attacking rooks on the board?
  (Rooks may still attack across deleted squares.)
\end{reqproblem} \printpuid{ZF13143F}

%% Type your solution to \href{https://otis.evanchen.cc/arch/ZF13143F/}{ZF13143F} here ...
We form a relation (bipartite graph) between the columns and the rows.
Specifically, we connect a row with a column if that row has a cell
in that column (i.e. it wasn't deleted).
Also, placing 1000 non-attacking rooks is just
a perfect matching between the rows and columns.

The condition of removing at most $k$ squares from each row and column
is equivalent to saying that each vertex has degree
greater than or equal to $1000-k$. If $1000-k \ge 1000/2 = 500$, meaning $k \le 500$,
then by the result of Problem 1, we are done.

If $k > 500$, then delete the bottom $k$ cells from the $k$ leftmost columns
and delete the leftmost $k$ cells from the bottom $k$ rows.
It can be easily checked that every row and column has either $k$ or $1000-k$ deleted cells,
which satisfies the condition.
Also, the first $k$ columns are only connected with $1000-k < k$ rows,
so Hall's condition is not satisfied.

\begin{problem}[Tuymaada 2018/7, $3\clubsuit$]
  A school has three senior classes of $M$ students each.
  Every student knows at least $\frac34M$ people in each of the other two classes.
  Prove that the school can send $M$ non-intersecting teams
  to the olympiad so that each team consists of $3$ students
  from different classes who know each other.
\end{problem} \printpuid{18TMD7}

%% Type your solution to Tuymaada 2018/7 (\href{https://otis.evanchen.cc/arch/18TMD7/}{18TMD7}) here ...
The solution is to do Hall twice. First, we consider only two of the classes.
By the result of problem 1, we can pair the students into $M$ pairs
where each pair consists of $2$ students from different classes who know each other.

Then, consider the $M$ pairs on one side of a bipartite graph,
and the $M$ students of the third senior class on the other side.
We connect a pair with a student from the third class if the student knows both students in the pair.
Notice that this graph has minimum degree $\frac 12 M$, because otherwise,
some student would not know at least $\frac 34 M$ students from each of the other two classes.
So, we use the result of problem 1 again to create $M$ teams of $3$.

  A \emph{flag} is a binary string of length $n$.
  We say that a set of $n$ flags is \emph{diverse} if these flags

  with the entries in its main diagonal all equal.
  Determine the smallest positive integer $M$ such that among any $M$ distinct flags,
  there exist $n$ flags forming a diverse set.
\end{reqproblem} \printpuid{10SLC2}

%% Type your solution to Shortlist 2010 C2 (\href{https://otis.evanchen.cc/arch/10SLC2/}{10SLC2}) here ...
We claim the answer is $M = 2^{n-2} + 1$. First, $2^{n-2}$ doesn't work;
just consider all the $2^{n-2}$ flags starting with $01$.

Now, we show that $M = 2^{n-2} + 1$ works.
Let $D$ be either $0$ or $1$, and construct a bipartite graph between
the set of $M$ flags (arranged into an $M$ by $n$ grid) and the $n$ columns.
We connect a row with column $i$ if that row has $D$ in column $i$.
It suffices to find a perfect matching from the columns to the rows (flags).

We claim that this graph satisfies Hall's condition for some choice of $D$, first starting with $k=1$.
Hall's condition for $k=1$ is only false for some $D$ if a column
has the binary digit other than $D$ in every row.
But this can't be true for both choices of $D$, as that
would restrict the number of unique flags to $2^{n-2} < M$.
So, at least one choice of $D$ satisfies Hall's condition for $k=1$.

We do casework on how many choices of $D$ satisfy Hall's condition for $k=1$.
If both choices of $D$ satisfy it, then
we claim that Hall's condition for $k=2$ must be true for some choice of $D$.
Suppose not. Then, $M-1$ rows must have $0$'s in two fixed columns,
and $M-1$ rows must have $1$'s in some two other fixed columns.
These conditions overlap in at least $M-2$ rows,
but the number of distinct flags that satisfy both is $2^{n-4} < M-2$, giving us a contradiction.

If only one choice of $D$ satisfies Hall's condition for $k-1$, then
WLOG let that choice be $D = 0$.
We claim that Hall's condition for $k=2$ must be true for $D = 0$.
Suppose not. Then, at least $M-1$ rows have $1$'s in two fixed columns.
These rows also have $0$ in another fixed column, since $D=1$ fails Hall's condition for $k=1$.
The number of distinct flags satisfying these conditions is $2^{n-3} < M-1$,
so we have a contradiction.
Therefore, Hall's condition must be true for $k=1,2$, for some choice of $D$.

Again WLOG that choice to be $D=0$, and in one final sweep,
we show Hall's condition for $k \ge 3$. Again, suppose not.
Then, at least $M-k+1$ flags have $1$ in some $k$ fixed columns.
But $2^{n-k}$ distinct flags satisfy that condition,
and $k \ge 3 \implies 2^{n-k} < M-k+1$, so we are done.

either $\nu_p(a) + \nu_p(b) = \nu_p(n)$ or $\nu_p(a) = \nu_p(b)$.
This relation is partially motivated by the representation of the
divisors of $n$ as lattice points in a hypercuboid.

We claim that in each equivalence class $C$, we can
construct a bijection $f$: $A \cap C \to B \cap C$
satisfying $d \mid f(d)$ for all $d$.

Notice that within each equivalence class $C$ and for a fixed prime $p \mid n$,
there are at most two possible values of $\nu_p(d)$ for $d \in C$. If
a prime has only one possible value of $\nu_p(d)$ for all $d \in C$,
then the divisibility condition is trivial for that prime (i.e. we might as well divide
all numbers in $C$ by that prime raised to the maximal exponent).
So, call a prime $p$ \textit{significant} when there are two possible values of $\nu_p(d)$,
and let $e_p$ be the smaller value and $E_p$ be the greater value.

Our bijection $f$ can be reframed as a bijection $g$ from $A \cap C$ to itself,
by reframing our condition $d \mid f(d)$ as
\[ \min\{\nu_p(d), \nu_p(g(d))\} = e_p \]
for all significant primes $p$.
From this, we can construct $f$ as $f(d) = \frac{n}{g(d)}$.

Now, we reframe the problem again. Let $X$ be the set of prime divisors of $n$,
and associate each element $d \in A \cap C$ with the set containing
all significant primes $p$ such that $d$ is divisible by $p^{E_p}$.
It is not hard to check that no two elements can be associated with the same set.

Consider the collection $\mathcal F$ of sets associated with elements
in $d$. This collection satisfies the property that for all $A \in \mathcal F$,
all subsets of $A$ are also in $\mathcal F$ (i.e. $\mathcal F$ is closed downward).
The central claim of the problem is that there exists a bijection
$\sigma: \mathcal F \to \mathcal F$ such that $\sigma(A) \cap A = \varnothing$
for every set $A \in \mathcal F$. This is indeed equivalent to the condition
for the bijection $g$ that we stated earlier. It is also a problem
from an earlier Iran olympiad: \url{https://aops.com/community/p20560}.

We proceed by induction on $\left\lvert X \right\rvert$.
The base case $\left\lvert X \right\rvert = 0$ is trivial.
For the inductive step, fix an element $x \in X$.
We divide the sets in $\mathcal F$ into three categories:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Type 1 sets:} Sets that contain $x$.
  \item \textbf{Type 2 sets:} Sets that don't contain $x$ but
  would become a type 1 set if $x$ were added to it.
  \item \textbf{Type 3 sets:} All other sets (not containing $x$).
\end{itemize}
Notice that the set of type 2 sets and the set of type 3 sets are each closed downward.
We construct $\sigma$ as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Let $\sigma_1$ be a bijection from the set of type 2 sets to itself,
  satisfying the condition $\sigma_1(A) \cap A = \varnothing$. It exists
  because of the inductive hypothesis.
  \item Similarly, let $\sigma_2$ be a bijection from the set of type 3 sets to itself,
  satisfying the condition.
  \item If $A$ is a type 1 set, then $\sigma$ takes $A$ to $\sigma_1(A \setminus \{x\})$.
  \item If $A$ is a type 2 set, then $\sigma$ takes $A$ to $\sigma_1(A) \cup \{x\}$.
  \item If $A$ is a type 3 set, then $\sigma(A) = \sigma_2(A)$.
\end{itemize}
One can check that this is indeed a bijection that satisfies our criterion.
