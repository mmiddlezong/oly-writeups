\section*{Problem 6}
Consider the polynomial with roots $r + s$, $s + t$, and $r + t$. We will find its coefficients and show that it is the desired polynomial.
Using Vieta's, we can see that
\[A = -2(r + s + t) = -14.\]
We can also see that
\[B = (r + s)(s + t) + (s + t)(r + t) + (r + s)(r + t).\]
Expanding and simplifying with Vieta's, we get $B = 52$.

The $C$ term is slightly more involved, but we can use a combination of Newton sums and grouping of terms to get $C = -23$.

All these terms are rational, so overall, our answer is $A + B + C = -14 + 52 - 23 = 15$.
